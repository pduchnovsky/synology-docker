## Why this exists

Synology ships Docker or, as they call it in later versions "Container Manager"... but it's OLD. Really old.

This repo gives you a **repeatable, reversible, and reasonably safe** way to:

* Update Docker Engine on Synology to the latest
* Update Docker Compose
* Escape Synology’s legacy `db` log driver
* Roll back if something goes sideways

If you’re comfortable with SSH and `sudo`, this is for you.

---

## ⚠️ Important warnings (read these first)

> **This is not supported by Synology.**
> You can absolutely break things if you ignore instructions. Always have backups.

### Nvidia users

If you use the Nvidia runtime, you may need to re‑run:

```bash
nvidia-ctk runtime configure
```

or restart the Nvidia driver **after** running this script.

### Portainer users (seriously, read this)

Portainer currently **persists the original logging driver** used when a container was created. This means:

* Containers created with the `db` logger will *stay broken* after upgrade
* You **must recreate** them to switch to `local`

👉 **Fix your loggers before upgrading Docker** or you’ll spend hours recreating containers anyway.

---

## What this script actually does

At a high level:

1. Downloads official Docker & Compose binaries
2. Backs up your existing Docker install
3. Stops Docker safely
4. Replaces binaries & config
5. Restarts Docker

Everything is scripted. Nothing is magic. Rollbacks are built‑in.

---

## Installation

SSH into your NAS and clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telnetdoogie/synology-docker.git
cd synology-docker
```

---

## 🚀 First‑time upgrade (do this once, carefully)

> **TL;DR:** Fix logging → recreate containers → upgrade Docker

### Step 1: Switch Docker’s default log driver

```bash
sudo ./syno_docker_update.sh logger
```

This:

* Sets Docker’s default log driver to `local`
* Restarts Docker

Then check which containers are *still* using `db`:

```bash
./syno_docker_list_containers.sh
```

Example output:

```
Container            Compose_Location                               Logger
-------------------  ---------------------------------------------- -------
/transmission        /volume1/docker/downloader/docker-compose.yml  db
/jellyfin            /volume1/docker/jellyfin/docker-compose.yml    db
/dozzle              /volume1/docker/dozzle/docker-compose.yml      local
```

---

### Step 2: Recreate containers still using `db`

For **each** compose‑managed container using `db`:

```bash
cd /volume1/docker/jellyfin
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Re‑run `syno_docker_list_containers.sh` until **everything** says `local`.

> Containers created via `docker run` will show a *best‑guess* recreate command. Verify it before running.

---

### Step 3: Upgrade Docker & Compose

```bash
sudo ./syno_docker_update.sh update
```

If you did the logger step correctly, containers should come back automatically.

---

## 🔁 Future updates (easy mode)

Once you’ve crossed the logging hurdle, updates are simple:

```bash
cd synology-docker
git pull
sudo ./syno_docker_update.sh update
```

sudo ./syno_docker_update.sh [OPTIONS] COMMAND
